      content: "Are you still unsure whether you should pursue an MBA or a Master’s in Management?
                If you’re an undergraduate student or recent graduate pursuing a career in business, a MiM could be for you. The degree typically attracts younger candidates with zero to one year of work experience.
                In contrast, the MBA attracts older candidates who already have established careers and a good number of years of work experience—anywhere from two or three, up to more than 10."
